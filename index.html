<br/>


<p>
As a member of the Pivotal product management org, I led engineering teams that are hyper-focused
on modern software dev methodology - TDD, paired programming, agile/lean/XP principles and
practices. I also served a complex set of stakeholders: an established open-source community, a
nascent account team and a small but demanding set of enterprise-level customers during a 2-year
period where Pivotal revenue from Cloud Foundry went from $0 to $125MM TCV/yr.

<p class="indent">
Cloud Foundry CLI PM - led a small agile engineering team developing the CF command line
toolset. (github.com/cloudfoundry/cli). Took on this lesser (than BOSH PM) role to free up
time and resources to begin engaging in deep feedback cycles with key customers - work that
would become my next role.
  </p>
  <br/>
<p class="indent">
BOSH PM - led an agile engineering team developing BOSH
(github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh). Responsible for BOSH CPI, agents, release and all
components of the BOSH product suite.

<h2>
Product Owner – TechOps Data Center Automation
</h2>
<br/>
<br/>


<p>Led multiple SCRUM teams in an agile environment to deliver key components of an automated infrastructure in support of the salesforce.com cloud service offering. Successful in delivery by forming strong relationships with stakeholders, owning product vision and translating that vision into a product by managing work in the backlog for prioritization and execution through to the production environment. Teams use a DevOps model to improve communication, reduce friction, increase velocity and deliver slices of working code to production every sprint; always aligned with release goals.
</p>

<p> Delivered automated host imaging and configuration system to all production datacenters resulting in two value add streams:
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p class="indent">
- Drove ongoing infrastructure build automation in all new/future datacenters as TechOps expands to meet business demand created by revenue growth from $1BB per year (FY10) to $1BB per quarter (Q4 FY14). Enables TechOps to build infrastructure faster with less labor and a substantial reduction in error rates; lowering costs on multiple vectors.
</p>
<p class="indent">
• Enabled reimaging and configuration of 10k hosts in existing datacenters which started in Q4’13. Bringing hosts under this management increases the ability to respond to security and compliance requirements, shortens maintenance windows and decreases error rates in production; lowering costs while protecting the saleforce.com brand.
